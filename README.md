About the Python Color_Detection Project

In this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. 
So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.

The project folder contains 3 files:

color_detection.ipynb - main source code of our project

colorpic.jpg - sample image for experimenting

colors.csv - a file that contains our dataset.
